wavetable synth engine for the [monome norns](https://monome.org/norns/) with [MIDI Polyphonic Expression](https://d30pueezughrda.cloudfront.net/campaigns/mpe/mpespec.pdf) control capability

march 2021<br>
Medford, MA, USA

## WARNINGS:

* ~ *work in progress* ~
* first supercollider project, expect nonsense
* name not final

### todo

* change name
* fix danging synth voices
* load new wavetables from params menu
* hook up pitchbend
* implement simple synth architecture and controlspecs/params (osc, filter, chorus)
* prepare preview release
* implement rest of synth architecture (2x wavetable osc, sub osc, 2x filter + chorus per voice)
* implement synth parameters and mod matrix, expose to norns knobs/params
* fix dropped note offs (might require norns midi changes)
* make everything work with non-MPE voice allocation
* move MPE logic out of main script into a lua library
* crow

### project core goals

* an expressively playable self-contained polysynth 
   * supporting [MPE](https://d30pueezughrda.cloudfront.net/campaigns/mpe/mpespec.pdf) and non-MPE capable MIDI controllers
* a simple but rich wavetable synthesis engine
   * sound and parameterization inspired by the architecture of classic wavetable hardware synthesizers from the 1990s
   * a small curated set of algorithmically generated and file-based wavetables based on my personal sensibilities
   * allow users to self-install arbitrary single-cycle wavetable collections
* MPE > CV via [crow]()

### project probable eventual goals

* drive synthesis modes of [Just Friends](https://www.whimsicalraps.com/products/just-friends) and [W/Syn](https://llllllll.co/t/mannequins-w-2-beta-testing/34091) via crow i2c
* arc parameter control, LFOs
* will think of some grid sequencing capabilities eventually

### hardware support
